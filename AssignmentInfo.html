	<h3 id="intro"> Introduction
		(<span class="Back"><a href="#start">Back to Beginning</a></span>) </h3>
	<p> This assignment consists of one task: to design and implement the website for
		a fictitious company to conduct online trading. This assignment is worth 
		20% of the total unit assessment. 
		The assignment covers materials from Topic 1 to Topic 10. </p>
	<p> Please note that one of objectives of this unit is to develop skills 
		in self-learning and research.  This assignment deliberately includes 
		features that requires independent research on your part in order to 
		come up with an solution. </p>
	<p> The assignment will be marked out of 100. 
		To achieve good mark you must strictly adhere to the <a href="#docs">Documentation and Submission Requirements</a>. </p>
	<p>The following sections provide the details of the assignment including
		its various requirements. If there are still things unclear to you
		after reading these sections, you should contact the Unit Coordinator
		for clarifications. </p>
	<h3 id="deadline"> Deadline and Penalty for Late Submission 
		(<span class="Back"><a href="#start">Back to Beginning</a></span>) </h3>
	<p> This submission deadline of this assignment is specified 
		in the Teaching Schedule page of the Unit LMS.  If there is any change
		in the submission deadline, it will be announced in the Announcements page
		of the Unit LMS. </p>
	<p> Assignments submitted on or before the deadline will be marked out of 100%. </p>
	<p> Late submission of the assignment will have 10% of the student's raw 
		marks deducted per day, unless an application for extension of submission
		deadline is granted. Submission that is late by more than 10 days 
		will not be accepted (in fact the Unit LMS will stop accepting assignments
		10  days after the published deadline). </p>
	<p> Applications for extension of your assignment deadline can only be made
		via email to the Unit Coordinator, normally prior to
		the specified due date of the assignment.  If an extension is granted
		(also by email), you must attach a copy of the email to your submission
		(see <a href="#docs">Documentation and Submission Requirements</a>). Applications for extension by phone
		or in person do not count even if granted.  The above policy will be
		rigorously enforced. </p>
	<h3 id="background"> Background (<span class="Back"><a href="#start">Back to Beginning</a></span>) </h3>
	<p> Your task is to design and implement the company website for a fictitious company 
		so that it can conduct its trade over the Internet. </p>
	<p> The fictitious company for which your website will be designed must
		meet all requirements specified in Task 1 in Major Assignment 1. As
		you have already described a fictitious company as part of 
		Major Assignment 1, you should  use that description as the starting
		point. You may need to improve the description of the company if
		your original description does not meet all requirements. </p>
	<p> You are required to use the following technologies to implement the
		website: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL. You may also use Ajax
		technology to implement searching, user authentication and database 
		update.
		You must not use any web content management framework/system  to create 
		this website unless you have obtained an written approval from the Unit 
		Coordinator. </p>
	<h3 id="basic"> Basic Features 
		(<span class="Back"><a href="#start">Back to Beginning</a></span>) </h3>
	<p> Your website should provide <em>the basic information </em> and <em>a search facility</em>. </p>
	<p> <span class="Emphasize">Basic Information:</span> Your website should provide all required company information and meet
		the following requirements. </p>
	<ol>
		<li> It contains the basic information about the company, for details see 
			points 1, 2, and 3 under Task 1 in Major Assignment 1. </li>
		<li> It has a consistent navigation system for users to move through your 
			website. </li>
		<li> It provides an online Help for users - instructions on how to use 
			your website. </li>
		<li> It comes with a site-map showing the structure of your website. </li>
		<li> It must use some of the new features available in HTML5, such as
			video and audio, to enhance the image of the company. </li>
		<li> While you should aim at making your website accessible to as many 
			browsers as possible, the fact is the support for HTML5 in some older 
			browsers is limited. For the purpose of assessment, your website 
			only need to be tested with Google Crome, Microsoft Internet Explorer 
			and Mozilla Firefox that were released since last year (I have lost 
			count of the version numbers. At the moment, there seems to be a 
			fierce competition among the various browser vendors on who can 
			come up with the highest version number :-)).  Your 
			website should also be served through the Apache web server with 
			PHP enabled - this is the set-up on the server where your 
			scripts will be assessed. </li>
	</ol>
	<p> <span  class="Emphasize">Search Facility:</span> In addition, your website must  have a search facility to allow users to 
		search for details of your products/services.  The search facility must meet 
		the following requirements: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>The raw product/service data must be stored in the MySQL database
			on the server. They must not be hard coded in the HTML pages.
			The data should be retrieved dynamically from the database and sent
			to the web browser in response to user enquiries. If new data 
			are added to the database, your website should not have to be 
			changed. </li>
		<li>The search facility is offered to users as HTML forms. 
			The required data on every form should be clearly identified to 
			the user, and these required fields should be checked to 
			ensure they are neither  empty nor invalid, before the data collected 
			from the form are sent to the server-side script. </li>
		<li>If a required field is found to be empty or containing invalid 
			data, the user should be forced to re-enter the data. </li>
		<li>Allow at least two levels of searching. The first form of search
			is by keywords, where an entry is retrieved from the database if the 
			user's search term matches any text in any fields in the entry. </li>
		<li>The second form of search is by browsing, where the user can go through 
			different categories of products/services to find what he or she wants.</li>
		<li>Your website should show the user his or her last search entry. </li>
	</ol>
	<h3 id="advanced"> Advanced Features
		(<span class="Back"><a href="#start">Back to Beginning</a></span>) </h3>
	<p> This part provides different functionalities to three different types 
		of users of the website: unregistered users, existing customers, 
		and support staff. </p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong><em>Unregistered Users</em></strong>: anyone without 
			authentication is given access to all basic functionalities specified 
			above, including search products/services by keywords and by browsing. </li>
		<li><strong><em>Existing Customers</em></strong>: an existing customer 
			has an account on the website. He/she needs to be authenticated before
			access is granted. Once access is granted, he/she can modify his or her
			personal details such as name, address, phone number and email address.
			He/she can also submit an order for the company's products or services.
			After it is validated by the client-side script, this order is sent to 
			the server-side script for processing.  The website will
			then display the confirmation of the order or rejection of the order
			(perhaps because not enough stock are available). If the order is 
			confirmed, the database should be updated. Please note that anyone can
			register an account from the company's website to become a customer
			of the company without the involvement of the company support staff. 
			It goes without saying that these customer account details must be kept 
			in the database. </li>
		<li><strong><em>Support Staff</em></strong>: a support staff member has 
			an account on the website. He/she needs to be authenticated before
			access is granted. Once access is granted, he/she can access any customer 
			account without using that customer's password. 
			He/she can also  modify product/service details in the database, 
			such as adding  a new product to the database, removing
			the details of a product from the database,  and changing the stock 
			information of a product. Please note that a support staff member with
			a support staff account can create new support staff accounts. </li>
	</ul>
	<p> Note that any existing customer and support staff member should still 
		be able to access the basic information and use the search facility
		just like any unregistered user, whether they are authenticated or not. </p>
	<p> To help your tutor mark your assignment, you are required to 
		create at least <strong><em>three</em></strong> existing customer accounts 
		and <strong><em>two</em></strong> support staff accounts on the website. 
		You should give the user names and passwords of these test accounts in 
		your assignment documentation. </p>
	<h3 id="docs"> Documentation and Submission Requirements 
		(<span class="Back"><a href="#start">Back to Beginning</a></span>) </h3>
	<p> Your assignment must be submitted in the form of a single 
		tar (or ZIP) archive file via the Unit LMS. The archive file must be
		named in the following format (assuming it is a tar file): </p>
	<pre>
A2_&lt;your family name&gt;_&lt;your first name&gt;.tar
</pre>
	<p> For example, the student, John Smith, would name his tar file as <code>A2_Smith_John.tar</code>. </p>
	<p> Your tar archive must contain the following files/directories: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p> One Microsoft Word document named "Assignment2.doc". This 
				file replaces the traditional hard-copy submission. 
				See the detailed requirements of this file later
				in this section. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p> A copy of your full website (a directory containing the files
				and subdirectories of your website).
				Note that you should use relative paths to refer to files in
				your website so that your website is portable (if you use
				absolute paths in your website, your website will only work
				on the system in which your website is developed.) </p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In addition to submitting website files to the Unit LMS, you must
		host your website on ceto using the default server (i.e., the 
		Apache server on port 80, not on your own Apache server). </p>
	<h4> The file "Assignment2.doc" </h4>
	<p> This Word file should contain the documents in the following order: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><a href="./ICT211MajorAssignmentTwoCheckList.doc"> ICT211 Assignment Two Check List</a>: 
				all students (internal and external) must 
				complete this check list and include it in your Word file. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p> Extension Granted: if you have been granted extension, 
				include the email from your Unit Coordinator after the 
				declaration form. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p> <span class="Emphasize">The task description </span>: 
				you can cut-and-paste the description from this web 
				page to your Word file. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><span class="Emphasize">Discussion of your solution</span>: 
				In particular, you should emphasise any aspect of your 
				solution that is novel or unusual. You should also 
				discuss technical choices available to you,  the consideration
				behind your technical choice, and whether the result of your 
				solution meets your expectation.  You should highlight the 
				strength and weakness of your solution and point out 
				what improvement can be made to the design of  your website. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><span class="Emphasize">Self diagnosis</span>: 
				referring to <em>Basic Features</em> and <em> Advanced 
				Features</em> specified above, give a statement with the 
				following details:  
				what features are fully working,  what features are fully 
				implemented but not fully working, and what features are 
				not fully implemented.
				This statement is essential. You will incur harsh
				penalty if you fail to provide this statement or if you 
				deliberately provide a vague or  misleading statement. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><span class="Emphasize">The URL of your live website 
				and details of five test accounts</span>:  in addition to 
				the website files included in 
				the tar archive, you must host your website on the default
				Apache HTTP server on ceto (i.e., the server listening 
				on port 80, not your own Apache server). 
				Furthermore, for testing purpose, you must provide the username 
				and password of three existing customer accounts and two 
				existing support staff accounts. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><span class="Emphasize">Architecture design 
				description</span>: describe the structure of your program 
				for future programmers (including yourself) who may want 
				to change and extend your source code, link with your 
				program, and/or use some components of your program.  
				In addition to the description, you should provide an 
				explanation of each web page file. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><span class="Emphasize">Test documentation</span>:
				your website must be thoroughly tested. You must provide evidence
				that <em>each required feature</em> is fully tested. You are 
				required to document the test cases for each required feature 
				to demonstrate that your
				website works as well as you have claimed. Each test 
				case should include the purpose of the 
				test, the outcome of the test and the evidence of the 
				test. The evidence may be in the form of one or several 
				screenshots. Marks will be awarded substantially based 
				on these documented test cases. <strong>Do not expect to receive an above 
				average mark unless your test documentation is complete
				and convincing</strong>. </p>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p class="Emphasize"> The documentation and submission requirements described above will be strictly 
		enforced.  Your assignment will not be marked, or your mark will be significantly
		reduced, if you fail to adhere to the above requirements. </p>
	<h3 id="marking"> Marking Guide 
		(<span class="Back"><a href="#start">Back to Beginning</a></span>) </h3>
	<p> Your assignment will be assessed based on the aesthetic quality, the 
		functionality, and the robustness of your website as well as the quality 
		of your documentation.  The breakdown of marks are: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Presentation quality of your documentation: 10% </li>
		<li> Basic features: 60%
			<ul>
				<li>The basic information: 30% </li>
				<li>Search by keywords: 15% </li>
				<li>Search by browsing: 15% </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li> Advanced features: 30%
			<ul>
				<li>functionalities related to existing customers: 15% </li>
				<li>functionalities related to support staff: 15% </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="policy"> Policy on the Reuse of the Third Party Source Code
		(<span class="Back"><a href="#start">Back to Beginning</a></span>) </h3>
	<p> Please read this section very carefully. </p>
	<p>All students are encouraged to solve the problems independently with
		their own source code. I understand, however, that occasionally there
		may be justifiable reasons to re-use source codes from a third party.
		Please note that if you have used one or more pieces of third party source
		codes in your program (this includes the situations where you have made
		minor modifications to the third party source code), your assignment
		will be acceptable only if you have satisfied all of the following
		conditions: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> The third party source code is fully identified, including the page
			numbers and line numbers in your hard-copy assignment documentation; </li>
		<li> The origin of the third party code is fully disclosed and acknowledged
			in your assignment submission; </li>
		<li> The third party source code is fully commented in your program listing.
			All variables, functions and major control structures must be commented to
			show clearly that you understand the logic of the code; </li>
		<li>The third party source code is less than 20% of your program
			(in terms of the number of lines), excluding the code specifically allowed
			to be used.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Failure to satisfy any one of the above conditions will result in
		0 mark being awarded to your entire assignment. </p>
	<p>The above policy will be rigorously enforced by the Unit Coordinator
		and Tutors. </p>
	<h3 id="grievance"> Grievance with Assignment Marking
		(<span class="Back"><a href="#start">Back to Beginning</a></span>) </h3>
	<p> Once your assignment is marked and the result is uploaded to the
		Unit LMS, if you 
		have any grievance with the marking, you must raise it with your 
		Unit Coordinator by email, within 7 days (from the date the marks
		are uploaded to the Unit LMS), or within the announced deadline in 
		the Unit LMS, whichever is earlier. 
		Otherwise the marks awarded to you will be final and will be used to calculate 
		your final weighted average score for the unit. </p>

	<p> This page is subject to change based on errors found. Any errors found
